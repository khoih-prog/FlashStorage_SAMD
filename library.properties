sentence=The FlashStorage library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory of SAMD21/SAMD51. It's using the buffered read and write to minimize the access to Flash. It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte.
paragraph=Useful if the EEPROM is not available or too small. Currently, ATSAMD21 and ATSAMD51 are supported (and consequently every board based on this cpu like the Arduino Zero, Aduino MKR1000, Nano-33 IoT, Itsy-Bitsy M4, etc).
