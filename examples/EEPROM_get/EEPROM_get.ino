  For SAMD21/SAMD51 using Flash emulated-EEPROM

  The FlashStorage_SAMD library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory
  of SAMD21/SAMD51. It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte.

    eeprom_get example.

    This shows how to use the EEPROM.get() method.

    To pre-set the EEPROM data, run the example sketch eeprom_put. This sketch will run without it.
    However, the values shown will be shown from what ever is already on the EEPROM.

    This may cause the serial object to print out a large string of garbage if there is no null character
    inside one of the strings loaded.
