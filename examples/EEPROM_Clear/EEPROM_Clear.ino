  EEPROM_Clear.ino
  For SAMD21/SAMD51 using Flash emulated-EEPROM

  The FlashStorage_SAMD library aims to provide a convenient way to store and retrieve user's data using the non-volatile flash memory
  of SAMD21/SAMD51. It now supports writing and reading the whole object, not just byte-and-byte.
